# Castica Language

A simple interpreted language.
I will make it compile to something later. It'll probably compile to my own computer design.

It's simple how it works. There is a pointer that points to the current line. Instructions like
for, if, else, while, repeat, etc., change the pointer. It then executes at the pointer.
